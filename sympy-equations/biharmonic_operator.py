    Computes the biharmonic operator applied to a function u with respect to variable x.
    
    The biharmonic operator is defined as the Laplacian of the Laplacian, or
    equivalently, the fourth derivative in one dimension.
    
    Parameters:
    u : sympy expression
        The function to which the biharmonic operator is applied.
    x : sympy symbol
        The variable with respect to which the operator is applied.
        
    Returns:
    sympy expression
        The result of applying the biharmonic operator to u.
