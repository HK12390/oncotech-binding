Modelling competitive particle-binding dynamics of a novel oncolytic virus T-cell chimera immunotherapy

Oncolytic viruses are a promising form of immunotherapy which work by infecting and lysing cancer cells, leaving healthy ones intact. Recently, an oncolytic virus T-cell chimera demonstrated capabilities in targeting tumor cells and subsequently causing downregulation of their expression of PD-L1, an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Physically attached oncolytic viruses are released from the surface of T-cells during binding to a tumor cell. The project will study the biophysics of particle competitive-binding and determine insights into potential therapeutic success. As a starting point, we anticipate using thermodynamically driven cell-adhesion models, such as the Bell model of cell adhesion, to quantify binding and release mechanisms of the virus from its T-cell carrier.
